	<h1 style="color:ghostwhite; font-family:baskerville; font-size:300%; text-align:center;">THE SONG OF ACHILLES</h1>

	<h2 style="color:ghostwhite; font-family:georgia; font-size:200%"><center>He is half of my soul,<br>as the poets say.</center></h2>

	<p style="color:ghostwhite; font-family:gill sans, sans-serif; text-align:right;"><i>Chiron had said once that nations were<br>the most foolish of mortal inventions.<br>“No man is worth more than another, wherever he is from.”<br></i></p>
	<p style="color:ghostwhite; font-family:gill sans, sans-serif; text-align:right;"><i>“But what if he is your friend?” Achilles had asked him,<br>feet kicked up on the wall of the rose-quartz cave.<br>“Or your brother? Should you treat him the same as a stranger?”<br></i></p>
	<p style="color:ghostwhite; font-family:gill sans, sans-serif; text-align:right;"><i>“You ask a question that philosophers argue over,” Chiron had said.<br>“He is worth more to you, perhaps. But the stranger is someone else’s<br>friend and brother. So which life is more important?”<br></i></p>
	<p style="color:ghostwhite; font-family:gill sans, sans-serif; text-align:right;"><i>We had been silent. We were fourteen,<br>and these things were too hard for us.<br>Now that we are twenty-seven, they still feel too hard.<br></i></p>
	<p style="color:ghostwhite; font-family:gill sans, sans-serif; text-align:right;"><i>He is half of my soul, as the poets say.<br>He will be dead soon, and his honor is all that will remain.<br>It is his child, his dearest self. Should I reproach him for it?<br>I have saved Briseis. I cannot save them all.<br></i></p>
	<p style="color:ghostwhite; font-family:gill sans, sans-serif; text-align:right;"><i>I know, now, how I would answer Chiron.<br>I would say: there is no answer.<br>Whichever you choose, you are wrong.<br></i></p>
